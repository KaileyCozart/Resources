Sass & SCSS – What’s The Difference?
Before we get into any examples and learn exactly how Sass works, let’s clarify something that bugs a lot of people. Sass and SCSS are often tossed around interchangeably by people who already know about it. To a newcomer, it can be confusing. Hugo Giraudel wrote a full article on the difference between Sass and SCSS, but I’ll cover the basics here.

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) refers to the preprocessor and syntax as a whole. It takes on its own syntax (the indented syntax), and compiles to readable CSS. We refer to the overall language as Sass.
SCSS (Sassy CSS) falls under the Sass umbrella. It is a CSS syntax that’s been turbocharged with all the goodness of Sass. Valid CSS is also valid SCSS, so the transition is swift and painless, and you can learn as much as you want at any time to improve your skills.
When I talk about Sass, I mean the Sass umbrella. I actually code with SCSS, and so do many people. It’s the natural step into the world of Sass, because you can dump all your CSS into an SCSS file and compile it perfectly. So, how exactly does all of this work?
